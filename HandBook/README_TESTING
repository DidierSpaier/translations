Tested with po4a-0.66

Procedure:

sh potize.sh # Output HandBook.sh
l=fr_FR sh gettextize.sh # Output fr_FR.HandBook.po
sed i "s~, dummy~~" fr_FR.HandBook.po
l=fr_FR sh translate.sh # Output fr_FR.HandBook.2.adoc
Caveat: diff -u fr_FR.HandBook.adoc fr_FR.HandBook.2.adoc
give like:
-switch-on emacspeak +
-switch-on speechd-el +
-switch-off emacspeak +
-switch-off speechd-el +
+switch-on emacspeak + switch-on speechd-el + switch-off emacspeak + switch-off speechd-el +

However in the case the \n should be preserved

Other issue:

if an asciidoc file include lines beginning with <letter o><space> they are
processed by po4a-gettextize like it it would have begun with <dot><space>
