Tested with po4a-0.66

Procedure:

sh potize.sh # Output HandBook.sh
l=fr_FR sh gettextize.sh # Output fr_FR.HandBook.po
l=fr_FR sh translate.sh # Triggers error message below:
Discard the translation of HandBook.pot (only 0% translated; need 80%).
Your input po file fr_FR.HandBook.po seems outdated (The amount of entries differ between files: 894 is not 895
). Please consider running po4a-updatepo to refresh it.

However, here if I type:
grep ^msgid HandBook.pot > entries.pot
grep ^msgid fr_FR.HandBook.po > entries.po
diff -u  entries.pot entries.po gives an empty output.

Doing this for pt_PT instead of fr_FR gives similar results

Conclusion: I am puzzled.
