po4a gettextize: Original has less strings than the translation (908<919). Please fix it by removing the extra entry from the translated file. You may need an addendum (cf po4a(7)) to reput the chunk in place after gettextization. A possible cause is that a text duplicated in the original is not translated the same way each time. Remove one of the translations, and you're fine.
po4a gettextization: Structure disparity between original and translated files:
msgid (at HandBook.adoc:165) is of type 'delimited block -' while
msgstr (at pt_PT.HandBook.adoc:162) is of type 'Plain text'.
Original text: sha256sum -c slint64-14.2.1.4.iso.sha256\n
Translated text: resultado deve ser: OK
(result so far dumped to gettextization.failed.po)
The gettextization failed (once again). Don't give up, gettextizing is a subtle art, but this is only needed once to convert a project to the gorgeous luxus offered by po4a to translators.
Please refer to the po4a(7) documentation, the section "HOWTO convert a pre-existing translation to po4a?" contains several hints to help you in your task
