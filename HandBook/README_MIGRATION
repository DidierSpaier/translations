Procedure used to migrate from Asciidoc to PO

1. Download the source file and the translations from Crowdin in asciidoc
format.

2. Run sh potize.sh to build HandBoook.pot from HandBook.adoc

3. For each translation, run: l=<ll_TT> sh gettextize.sh to try to build
<ll_TT>.HandBook.po from <ll_TT>.HandBook.adoc

4. fix the errors found at the previous step editing by hand the files
<ll_TT>.HandBook.adoc and HandBook.adoc. Not funny at all to do :(
After edit these files are sored in ./asciidoc

5. Run again l=<ll_TT> sh gettextize.sh to actually build the PO files

6. Copy the POT file and the PO files in ./PO

7. To check the ability to translate the PO files to PO format, remove the
"fuzzy" tags from the PO files, the for each PO file run
l=<ll_TT> sh translate.sh

8. Fix the errors found at the previous step, editing each PO file to:
- insure that the translated string ends with a \n or not, as the source string
- insure that no translated line begins with ". ","o " or "O " as this
de-synchronize the source and the translation

9. Run again l=<ll_TT> sh translate.sh, to build the new <ll_TT>.HandBook.adoc
files. These file have been built only to make sure the PO files are clean,
the files in ./asciidoc are those downloaded from Crowdin with only the edits
performed at step 4.

It appears that in some translations consecutive lines including links (to
display a sub-menu) are merged, but this is a small issue, as it will be solved
post-processing the .adoc files with a simple sed command.

Other issues found (for which workarounds have been used), which will reported
to the po4a developers:

1. If an asciidoc file lines beginning with <letter o><space> or
<letter O><space> are processed by po4a-gettextize as it if they would have
begun with <dot><space>. I

2. If this source string in English:
==  Install Slint
if translated in Ukrainian:
==  Встановлення Slint
or in Russian:
==  Установка Slint
I get error message like this for Ukrainian:

po4a gettextization: Structure disparity between original and translated files:
msgid (at HandBook.adoc:103) is of type 'Title ==' while
msgstr (at uk_UA.HandBook.adoc:103 uk_UA.HandBook.adoc:309) is of type 'Title ==='.

and similar for Ukrainian.
